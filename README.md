# Price-Alerts
Crypto Price Alert Pipeline is an automated personal system that monitors cryptocurrency markets in real time and notify me of significant price changes. A script fetches live price data from an API and streams it to a message broker, Apache Kafka. A separate Python script, then reads this data from Kafka, performs two key tasks: it stores the high-frequency price information in a PostgreSQL database for historical analysis and checks if the current price of a cryptocurrency has crossed a predefined threshold. If a threshold is met, the system sends an instant email notification, eliminating my need for constant manual tracking and ensuring timely alerts for market movements.
